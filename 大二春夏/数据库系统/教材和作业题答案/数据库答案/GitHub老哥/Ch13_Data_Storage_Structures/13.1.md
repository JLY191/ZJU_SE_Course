--------------------------------

a. Although moving record 6 to the space for 5 and moving record 7 to the space for 6 is 
the most straightforward approach, it requires moving the most records and involves the most
accesses.

b. Moving record 7 to the space for 5 moves fewer records (than option **a**) but destroys
any ordering in the file. 

c. Marking the space for 5 as deleted preserves ordering and moves no records, but it requires 
additional overhead to keep track of all of the free space in the file. This method may lead 
to too many "holes" in the file, which if not compacted from time to time, will affect performance 
because of the reduced availability of contiguous free records.
