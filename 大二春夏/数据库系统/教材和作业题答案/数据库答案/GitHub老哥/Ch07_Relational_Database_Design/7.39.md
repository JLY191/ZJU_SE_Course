--------------------------------

2NF does not prohibit as much repetition of information since the schema 
$(A,B,C)$ with dependencies $A \rightarrow B$ and $B \rightarrow C$ is 
allowed under 2NF, although the same $(B,C)$ pair could be associated with 
many $A$ values, needlessly duplicating $C$ values. To void this we must go to 3NF. 
Repetition of information is allowed in 3NF in some but not all of 
the cases where it is allowed in 2NF. Thus, in general, 3NF reduces 
repetition of information. Since we can always achieve a lossless 
decomposition into 3NF, there is no loss of information needed in going 
from 2NF to 3NF. 

Note that the decomposition $\{ \{A, B\}, \{B, C\} \}$ is a dependency-preserving 
3NF decomposition of the schema $(A, B, C)$. However, in case we choose this decomposition, 
retrieving information about the relationship between $A$, $B$ and $C$ requires a join 
of two relations, which is avoided in the corresponding 2NF decomposition.
