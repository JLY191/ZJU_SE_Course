Let $R = (A, B)$ be a schema with two attributes. Let $F$ be a set of 
functional dependencies that hold on $R$. 

We want to show:- $R$ is in BCNF. 

Suppose to the contrary that $R$ is not in BCNF. That is, there exists 
$\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ in $F^+$ that is **not** trivial and $\alpha$ is 
**not** a superkey. 

Since $\alpha \subseteq R$ and $\beta \subseteq R$, we know that, 
both $\alpha, \beta \in \{ \{A\}, \{B\}, \{A,B\} \}$.

* **Case 1**: $\alpha = \{A\}$
    * **Sub-Case 1**: $\beta =  \{A\}$ <br> 
    This sub-case is impossible since, it would make the functional dependency 
    trivial. And we have assumed that the functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$
    is not trivial. 

    * **Sub-Case 2**: $\beta =  \{B\}$ <br> 
    Then we can write $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ as $\{A\} \rightarrow \{B\}$. By
    **Reflexivity rule** followed by **Union rule** we know that this $\{A\} \rightarrow \{A, B\}$
    holds. This means $\alpha$ is a superkey. But we have assumed $\alpha$ is not a superkey. 
    Thus this sub-case is also impossible. 

    * **Sub-Case 3**: $\beta =  \{A,B\}$ <br> 
    Also impossible, since this would make $\alpha$ a superkey. And we have assumed that
    $\alpha$ is not a superkey. 

* **Case 2**: $\alpha = \{B\}$
    * **Sub-Case 1**: $\beta =  \{A\}$ <br> 
    Then we can write $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ as $\{B\} \rightarrow \{A\}$. By
    **Reflexivity rule** followed by **Union rule** we know that this $\{B\} \rightarrow \{A, B\}$
    holds. This means $\alpha$ is a superkey. But we have assumed $\alpha$ is not a superkey. 
    Thus this sub-case is impossible. 

    * **Sub-Case 2**: $\beta =  \{B\}$ <br> 
    This sub-case is impossible since, it would make the functional dependency 
    trivial. And we have assumed that the functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$
    is not trivial.

    * **Sub-Case 3**: $\beta =  \{A,B\}$ <br> 
    Also impossible, since this would make $\alpha$ a superkey. And we have assumed that
    $\alpha$ is not a superkey. 

* **Case 3**: $\alpha = \{A,B\}$
    * This case is impossible, since $\alpha$ is obviously a superkey. 


Therefore $R$ is in BCNF.
