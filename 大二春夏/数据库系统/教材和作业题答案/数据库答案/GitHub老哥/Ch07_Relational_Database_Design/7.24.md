> Why are certain functional dependencies called _trivial_ functional dependencies? 

--------------------------------

Let $r(R)$ be any relation. Let $\alpha \subseteq R, \beta \subseteq R, \text{ and }
\beta \subseteq \alpha$. Then we know that the functional dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ holds
even though we don't know any thing about $r(R)$. $r(R)$ could have been **any** relation and our statement 
will hold true. This is unintersting to us, so we call it trivial.
