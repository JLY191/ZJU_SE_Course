--------------------------------

No. That is $A \twoheadrightarrow BC$ **does not** logically 
imply $A \twoheadrightarrow B$ and $A \twoheadrightarrow C$.


It is clear that the multivalued dependency $A \twoheadrightarrow BC$
holds on the following instance of $r$. 

A|B|C|D
-|-|-|-
1|3|7|2
1|6|4|5
1|3|7|5
1|6|4|2

The following Python3 code verifies exactly just that (in fact it does more than that).

            return False
    return True

        t2 represent tuples in the instance of the relation that don't

However, the multivalued dependency $A \twoheadrightarrow B$ does NOT hold. 

The following explanation shows it does not hold. 

Now let's assume to the contrary that the multivalued dependency 
$A \twoheadrightarrow B$ holds. 

Take $t_1 = (1, 3, 7, 2)$ and $t_2 = (1, 6, 4, 5)$. 

Note that the first component of $t_1$ is value of attribute $A$, the second 
component of $t_1$ is value of attribute $B$ and so on. Similarly for $t_2$. 

Since the **multivalued dependency** $A \twoheadrightarrow B$ holds we know that 
there exist tuples $t_3$ and $t_4$ in $r$ satisfying the conditions of the definition 
of **multivalued dependency**. Take $\alpha := \{A\}$ and $\beta := \{B\}$. Then 
$R - \beta = \{A, C, D\}$.

We know that $t_3[\beta] = t_1[\beta]$. 

$t_1[\beta] = t_1[\{B\}] = 3$

Thus we know the value of the attribute $B$ in tuple $t_3$, it is $3$. 

We also know that $t_3[R - \beta] = t_2[R - \beta]$.

$t_2[R - \beta] = t_2[\{A, C, D\}] = (1, 4, 5)$

Thus we know the value of the attributes $(A,C,D)$ of tuple $t_3$, they are 
$(1, 4, 5)$. 

Putting our results together, we get $t_3 = (1, 3, 4, 5)$.

But we see that the tuple $t_3$ doesn't belong to the instance of $r$ that we took. 

Thus the multivalued dependency $A \twoheadrightarrow B$ **DOES NOT** hold.

Therefore, $A \twoheadrightarrow BC$ **DOES NOT** logically 
imply $A \twoheadrightarrow B$ and $A \twoheadrightarrow C$.
