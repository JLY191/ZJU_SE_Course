> Using the functional dependencies of Exercise 7.6, compute the canonical cover $F_c$.

--------------------------------

The given set of FDs (Functional Dependencies) $F$ is:-

$$
A \rightarrow BC \\ 
CD \rightarrow E \\ 
B \rightarrow D \\
E \rightarrow A 
$$

The left side of each FD in $F$ is unique. Also, none of the attributes in the left side 
or right side of any of the FDs is extraneous. Therefore the canonical cover $F_c$ is 
equal to $F$.
