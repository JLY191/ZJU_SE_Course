--------------------------------

a. $\alpha$ should be a primary key for $r_1$, and $\alpha$ should be the foreign key from $r_2$, referencing $r_1$.

b. If the foreign key constraint is not enforced, then a deletion of a tuple from $r_1$ would 
not have a corresponding deletion from the referencing tuples in $r_2$. Instead of deleting a tuple
from $r$, this would amount to simply setting the value of $\alpha$ to null in some tuples.

c. For every schema $r_i(\alpha\beta)$ added to the decomposition because of a functional 
dependency $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$, $\alpha$ should be made the primary key. Also, 
a candidate key $\gamma$ for the original relation is located in some newly created relation 
$r_k$ and is a primary key for that relation. 
Foreign-key constrains are created as follows: for each relation $r_i$ created above, 
if the primary key attributes of $r_i$ also occur in any other relation $r_j$, then a 
foreign-key constraint is created from those attributes in $r_j$, referencing (the primary key of)
$r_i$.
