# Extension of the hash-join algorithm to compute the **natural left outer join (⟕)**

Let say we want to compute $r ⟕ s$.
As written in the book, we generally want the smaller relation to be the build relation. 

## Case 1: The number of blocks of $r$ is much smaller than the number of blocks of $s$

Thus we choose $r$ as the **build relation**.  Thus $s$ is the **probe relation**. We first
partition $r$ into the partitions $r_0, r_1, ..., r_{n_h}$, identical to the way given in 
Figure 15.10. We then partition $s$ into the partitions $s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n_h}$ identical 
to the way given in Figure 15.10. We assume for simplicity that **Recursive Partitioning** is not 
needed. We also assume that **Hash-table overflow** does not occur.

For $i \in \{0, 1, ..., n_h\}$ we do the following: 

1. Read partition $r_i$ and build an in-memory hash index on it (the hash function used to build this is different from
the one used earlier). 
2. When building the in-memory hash index on $r_i$ we keep a boolean with each tuple in $t_{r_i} \in r_i$. We initialize this boolean to **False** initially. Suppose also we can 
access this boolean as $t_{r_i}.b$.
3. For each tuple $t_{s_i} \in s_i$ we do the following: 
    * Probe the in-memory hash index on $r_i$ to locate all tuples $t_{r_i}$ such that $t_{r_i}[JoinAttrs] = t_{s_i}[JoinAttrs]$
    * For each **matching** tuple $t_{r_i} \in r_i$ we do the following: 
        * Add $t_{r_i} \bowtie t_{s_i}$ to the result. 
        * We set $t_{r_i}.b$ to **True**. 
4. For each tuple $t_{r_i} \in r_i$
    * If $t_{r_i}.b$ is **False**
        * Add $t_{r_i}$ padded with nulls to the result.

## Case 2: The number of blocks of $s$ is much smaller than the number of blocks of $r$

Thus we choose $s$ as the **build relation**.  Thus $r$ is the **probe relation**. We first
partition $r$ into the partitions $r_0, r_1, ..., r_{n_h}$, identical to the way given in 
Figure 15.10. We then partition $s$ into the partitions $s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n_h}$ identical 
to the way given in Figure 15.10. We assume for simplicity that **Recursive Partitioning** is not 
needed. We also assume that **Hash-table overflow** does not occur.

For $i \in \{0, 1, ..., n_h\}$ we do the following: 

1. Read partition $s_i$ and build an in-memory hash index on it (the hash function used to build this is different from
the one used earlier).
3. For each tuple $t_{r_i} \in r_i$ we do the following: 
    * Probe the in-memory hash index on $s_i$ to locate all tuples $t_{s_i}$ such that $t_{r_i}[JoinAttrs] = t_{s_i}[JoinAttrs]$
    * If there **does not** exist such tuples that satisfy this: 
        * Add $t_{r_i}$ padded with nulls to the result.
    * Else: 
        * For each **matching** tuple $t_{s_i} \in s_i$ we do the following: 
            * Add $t_{r_i} \bowtie t_{s_i}$ to the result. 

If relations $r$ and $s$ are roughly the same size, then I think performing **Case 2** given 
above will result in better performance, since it does not keep booleans/extra information.

# Extension of the hash-join algorithm to compute the **natural right outer join (⟖)**

Let say we want to compute $r ⟖ s$. This is equivalent to $s ⟕ r$. And we know how to 
perform **natural left outer join** using the **hash-join algorithm** (see above).


# Extension of the hash-join algorithm to compute the **natural full outer join (⟗)**

We know that **natural full outer join** is commutative. That is $r ⟗ s$ results in the same relation as $s ⟗ r$.

Let's say we want to compute $r ⟗ s$. Without loss of generality, assume the number of blocks 
of $r$ is less than or equal to the number of blocks of $s$. Thus we choose $r$ as our 
**build relation** and $s$ as our **probe relation**. We first
partition $r$ into the partitions $r_0, r_1, ..., r_{n_h}$, identical to the way given in 
Figure 15.10. We then partition $s$ into the partitions $s_0, s_1, ..., s_{n_h}$ identical 
to the way given in Figure 15.10. We assume for simplicity that **Recursive Partitioning** is not 
needed. We also assume that **Hash-table overflow** does not occur.

For $i \in \{0, 1, ..., n_h\}$ we do the following: 

1. Read partition $r_i$ and build an in-memory hash index on it (the hash function used to build this is different from
the one used earlier). 
2. When building the in-memory hash index on $r_i$ we keep a boolean with each tuple in $t_{r_i} \in r_i$. We initialize this boolean to **False** initially. Suppose also we can 
access this boolean as $t_{r_i}.b$.
3. For each tuple $t_{s_i} \in s_i$ we do the following: 
    * Probe the in-memory hash index on $r_i$ to locate all tuples $t_{r_i}$ such that $t_{r_i}[JoinAttrs] = t_{s_i}[JoinAttrs]$
    * If there **does not** exist such tuples that satisfy this: 
        * Add $t_{s_i}$ padded with nulls to the result.
    * Else: 
        * For each **matching** tuple $t_{r_i} \in r_i$ we do the following: 
            * Add $t_{r_i} \bowtie t_{s_i}$ to the result. 
            * We set $t_{r_i}.b$ to **True**. 
4. For each tuple $t_{r_i} \in r_i$
    * If $t_{r_i}.b$ is **False**
        * Add $t_{r_i}$ padded with nulls to the result.
