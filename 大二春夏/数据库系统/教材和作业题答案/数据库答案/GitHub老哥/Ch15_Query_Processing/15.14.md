--------------------------------

By using a **classification hierarchy** in which the general concepts lie in the upper parts 
of the hierarchy and the specializations lie in the lower parts of the hierarchy. 

I highly recommend reading **Section 31.9 Directories and Categories** from the 
online chapter of the book "[Chapter 31: Information Retrieval](https://www.db-book.com/online-chapters-dir/31.pdf)". It is free.
