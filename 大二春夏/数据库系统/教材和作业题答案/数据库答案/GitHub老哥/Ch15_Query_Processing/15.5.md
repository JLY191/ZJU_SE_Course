--------------------------------

We can store the entire smaller relation in memory, read the larger relation block by block, 
and perform nested-loop join using the larger one as the outer relation. The number of I/O operations
is equal to $b_r + b_s$, and the memory requirement is $\min(b_r, b_s) + 2$ pages.
