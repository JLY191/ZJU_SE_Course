Query: 

$  \Pi_{T.branch\_name} ( (\Pi_{branch\_name, assets}(\rho_T(branch))) \bowtie_{T.assets > S.assets}  (\Pi_{assets} (\sigma_{branch\_city = 'Brooklyn'}(\rho_S(branch))))) $

This expression performs the theta join on the smallest amount of data possible. It does 
this by restricting the right-hand side operand of the join to only those branches in Brooklyn
and also eliminating the unneeded attributes from both the operands.
