> a. Find the titles of all courses taken by any student named Zhang. 

```sparql
select ?title 
where { 
    ?student_id         name            "Zhang"
    ?student_id         takes           ?section_id
    ?section_id         sec_course      ?course_id
    ?course_id          title           ?title
}
```

> b. Find titles of all courses such that a student named Zhang takes a 
> section of the course that is taught by an instructor named Srinivasan. 

```sparql
select ?title 
where {
    ?student_id         instance-of     student 
    ?student_id         name            "Zhang"
    ?instructor_id      instance-of     instructor 
    ?instructor_id      name            "Srinivasan"
    ?student_id         takes           ?sec
    ?instructor_id      teaches         ?sec
    ?sec                sec_course      ?course_id
    ?course_id          title           ?title
}
```

> c. Find the attribute names and values of all attributes of the instructor 
> named Srinivasan, without enumerating the attribute names in your query. 

```sparql
select ?attribute_name, ?attribute_value 
where {
    ?instructor_id      instance-of         instructor 
    ?instructor_id      name                "Srinivasan"
    ?instructor_id      ?attribute_name     ?attribute_value
}
```

Note that unlinke in SQL, the predicate in a triple pattern can be a 
variable, which can match any relationship or attribute name.
