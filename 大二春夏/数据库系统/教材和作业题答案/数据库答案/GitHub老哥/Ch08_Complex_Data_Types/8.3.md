For this problem, we use table inheritance. We assume that **MyDate**, **Color** 
and **DriveTrainType** are pre-defined types. 

```sql 
CREATE TYPE Vehicle (
    vehicle_id INTEGER, 
    license_number CHAR(15), 
    manufacturer CHAR(30), 
    model CHAR(30), 
    purchase_date MyDate, 
    color Color
);

CREATE TABLE vehicle OF TYPE Vehicle;

CREATE TABLE truck (
    cargo_capacity INTEGER
) UNDER vehicle;

CREATE TABLE sportsCar ( 
    horsepower INTEGER, 
    renter_age_requirement INTEGER
) UNDER vehicle;

CREATE TABLE van (
    num_passengers INTEGER
) UNDER vehicle;

CREATE TABLE offRoadVehicle ( 
    ground_clearance REAL, 
    driveTrain DriveTrainType
) UNDER vehicle;
```

If you use postgresql you can use the following code:- 

```sql 
CREATE TYPE COLOR AS ENUM (
    'Red',
    'Orange',
    'Yellow',
    'Green',
    'Cyan',
    'Blue',
    'Magenta',
    'Purple'
);

CREATE TYPE DriveTrainType AS ENUM (
    '4-wheel',
    '2-wheel'
);

CREATE TABLE vehicle (
    vehicle_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, 
    license_number CHAR(15), 
    manufacturer CHAR(30), 
    model CHAR(30), 
    purchase_date DATE, 
    vehicle_color COLOR
);

CREATE TABLE truck (
    cargo_capacity INTEGER
) INHERITS (vehicle);

CREATE TABLE sportsCar ( 
    horsepower INTEGER, 
    renter_age_requirement INTEGER
) INHERITS (vehicle);

CREATE TABLE van (
    num_passengers INTEGER
) INHERITS (vehicle);

CREATE TABLE offRoadVehicle ( 
    ground_clearance REAL, 
    driveTrain DriveTrainType
) INHERITS (vehicle);
```
