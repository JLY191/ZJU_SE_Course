--------------------------------

Operating systems try to ensure that consecutive blocks of a file are 
stored on consecutive disk blocks. This is because, when processing the file 
(that is stored on disk), most programs perform a **sequential access pattern**.
To read blocks in sequential access, a disk seek may be required for the 
first block, but successive requests would either not require a seek, or require
a seek to an adjacent track, which is faster than a seek to a track that is 
farther away. Data transfer rates are highest, when consecutive file blocks are stored
on consecutive disk blocks (since seek time is minimal).

Storing consecutive blocks of a file on consecutive disk blocks, also improves
performance when using SSDs. This is because of the read-ahead caching that is performed.
