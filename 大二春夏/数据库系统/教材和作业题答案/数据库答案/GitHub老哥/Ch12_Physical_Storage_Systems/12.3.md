It is stored as an array containing physical page numbers, indexed by logical 
page numbers.

* Our flash storage system has 64-gigabytes. 
* Page size is 4096-bytes. 
* Thus the number of pages in our flash storage system is:- 

$$
\frac{64 \times 10^9}{4096} = 15,625,000 
$$

* So, for each of the $15,625,000$ pages in our flash storage system, 
their physical address is going to be in the array (flash translation table). 
You can also think of $15,625,000$ as the length of our array. 

* A single address takes 32 bits, which equals, 4 bytes.

* Thus the number of bytes that our array will take is: 

$$
15,625,000 \times 4 = 62,500,000
$$

or 62.5 Megabytes.

If the mapping is such that every p consecutive logical page numbers are mapped to p 
consecutive physical pages, we can store the mapping of the first page for every p 
pages. This reduces the in-memory structure by a factor of p. Further, if p is an exponent
of 2, we can avoid some of the least significant digits of the addresses stored.
