```sql

-- Takes a company name as an argument and finds the average salary of
-- employees at that company.
CREATE FUNCTION avg_salary(company_name VARCHAR(20))
    RETURNS REAL
    BEGIN
    DECLARE retval REAL;
        SELECT AVG(salary)
        FROM works
        WHERE works.company_name = company_name;
    RETURN retval;
    END;

SELECT DISTINCT company_name
FROM works
WHERE avg_salary(company_name) > avg_salary('First Bank');
