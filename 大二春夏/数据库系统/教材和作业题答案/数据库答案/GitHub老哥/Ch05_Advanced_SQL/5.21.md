--------------------------------

Note that the below query is going to give us an infinite table, if there is a 
cycle in the `prereq` relation. For example suppose course `A` has course `B` as a 
prerequisite and course `B` has course `A` as a prerequisite (i.e. the tuples
`(A,B)` and `(B,A)` both appear inside of `prereq`). In the query of Figure 5.16
since there was no attribute varying (like we have `depth` here), fixed point will
be reached even if there are such cycles. (Read more in section 5.4.2).

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE prereq_depth(course_id,prereq_id,depth) AS (
    SELECT course_id,prereq_id,0 AS depth
    FROM prereq
    UNION
    SELECT prereq_depth.course_id, prereq.prereq_id, prereq_depth.depth + 1
    FROM prereq_depth, prereq
    WHERE prereq_depth.prereq_id = prereq.course_id 
)
SELECT * FROM prereq_depth;
``` 

The following query tries to solve this problem.

```sql
CREATE TABLE temp_prereq (
    course_id VARCHAR(8),
    prereq_id VARCHAR(8),
    PRIMARY KEY (course_id,prereq_id)
);

-- make_sure_it_is_not_duplicate returns true if it is the first time
-- that (course_id,prereq_id) is passed into the function. false otherwise.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION make_sure_it_is_not_duplicate(course_id VARCHAR(8), prereq_id VARCHAR(8))
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS 
$$
BEGIN
    IF ((course_id,prereq_id) IN (SELECT * FROM temp_prereq)) THEN
        RETURN 'f'; -- it is a duplicate
    ELSE 
        INSERT INTO temp_prereq VALUES (course_id, prereq_id);
        RETURN 't'; -- not a duplicate
    END IF;
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;

WITH RECURSIVE prereq_depth(course_id,prereq_id,depth) AS (
    SELECT course_id,prereq_id,0 AS depth
    FROM prereq 
    WHERE make_sure_it_is_not_duplicate(course_id,prereq_id) AND 
        course_id <> prereq_id -- the case where the course is a prerequisite of itself.
    UNION
    SELECT prereq_depth.course_id, prereq.prereq_id, prereq_depth.depth + 1
    FROM prereq_depth, prereq
    WHERE prereq_depth.prereq_id = prereq.course_id 
        AND make_sure_it_is_not_duplicate(prereq_depth.course_id, prereq.prereq_id)
)
SELECT * FROM prereq_depth;

-- we don't need temp_prereq anymore. It has served its purpose.
DROP TABLE temp_prereq;
```
