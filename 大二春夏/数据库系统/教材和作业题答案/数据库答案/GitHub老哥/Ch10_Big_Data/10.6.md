> a. How does Apache Spark perform computations in parallel? 

RDDs are stored partitioned across multiple nodes. Each of the transformation 
operations on an RDD are executed in parallel on multiple nodes.

Transformations are not executed immediately but postponed until the result is 
required for functions such as _collect()_ or _saveAsTextFile()_.

The operations are organized into a tree, and query optimization can be applied to 
the tree to speed up computation. Also, answers can be pipelined from one operation to 
another, without being written to disk, to reduce time overheads of disk storage.
