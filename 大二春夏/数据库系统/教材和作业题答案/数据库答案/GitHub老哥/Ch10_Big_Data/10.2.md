--------------------------------

We would store the student data as a JSON object, with the _takes_ tuples for 
the student stored as a JSON array of objects, each object corresponding to a 
single _takes_ tuple. 

```json
{
    "id": "12345",
    "name": "Shankar", 
    "dept_name": "Comp. Sci.", 
    "tot_cred": 32, 
    "takes": [
        {
            "sec_id": 1, 
            "semester": "Fall", 
            "year": 2017, 
            "grade": "C", 
            "course_id": "CS-101", 
        }, 
        {
            "sec_id": 2, 
            "semester": "Spring", 
            "year": 2017, 
            "grade": "A", 
            "course_id": "CS-190", 
        }, 
        {
            "sec_id": 1, 
            "semester": "Spring", 
            "year": 2018, 
            "grade": "A", 
            "course_id": "CS-315", 
        },
        {
            "sec_id": 1, 
            "semester": "Fall", 
            "year": 2017, 
            "grade": "A", 
            "course_id": "CS-347", 
        },  
    ]
}
```
