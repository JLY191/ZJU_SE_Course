--------------------------------

Remember that the schema of the relation _order_ is _order(orderid, datetime, itemid, amount)_. 
Divide by 3600, and take floor, group by that. To output the timestamp of the window
end, add 1 to hour and multiply by 3600. 

```sql 
WITH o(itemid, hour, amount) AS ( 
    SELECT itemid, floor(to_seconds(datetime)/3600), amount
    FROM order 
)
SELECT itemid, (hour + 1) * 3600 as window_end, SUM(amount)
FROM o
GROUP BY itemid, hour;
```
