--------------------------------

a. Find the total number of people who owned cars that were involved in accidents in 2017.
<br>

Note: This is not the same as the total number of accidents in 2017. We must count people
with several accidents only once. Furthermore, note that the question asks for owners, 
and it might be that the owner of the car was not the driver actually involved in the 
accident. 

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT person.driver_id)
FROM accident, participated, person, owns
WHERE accident.report_number = participated.report_number
      AND owns.driver_id = person.driver_id 
      AND owns.license_plate = participated.license_plate
      AND year = 2017
```

b. Delete all year-2010 cars belonging to the person whose ID is '12345'.

```sql
DELETE FROM car
WHERE year = 2010 AND license_plate IN 
    (SELECT license_plate FROM owns WHERE driver_id = '12345')
```

Note: The _owns_, _accident_ and _participated_ records associated with the 
deleted cars still exist. (If you want the corresponding rows in _owns_ and 
_participated_ to also be deleted you can use **ON CASCADE DELETE** on the schema
of the tables).
