--------------------------------

a. Find the ID of each customer of the bank who has an account but not a loan.

```sql 
(SELECT ID FROM depositor)
EXCEPT 
(SELECT ID FROM borrower)
```

b. Find the ID of each customer who lives on the same street and in the same city 
as customer '12345'

```sql 
SELECT F.ID
FROM customer AS F, customer AS S
WHERE F.customer_street = S.customer_street
    AND F.customer_city = S.customer_city
    AND S.customer_id = '12345';
```

Another method (using **scalar subqueries**)

```sql
SELECT ID 
FROM customer 
WHERE customer_street = (SELECT customer_street FROM customer WHERE ID = '12345') AND 
    customer_city = (SELECT customer_city FROM customer WHERE ID = '12345')
```

c. Find the name of each branch that has at least one customer who has an account
in the bank and who lives in "Harrison".

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT branch_name
FROM account, depositor, customer 
WHERE customer.id = depositor.id
    AND depositor.account_number = account.account_number 
    AND customer_city = 'Harrison'
```
