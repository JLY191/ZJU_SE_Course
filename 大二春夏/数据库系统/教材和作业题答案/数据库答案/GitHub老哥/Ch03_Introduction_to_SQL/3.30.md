Consider the following instance of the _instructor_ relation. 

```
university=# SELECT * FROM instructor;
  id   |    name    | dept_name  |  salary   
-------+------------+------------+-----------
 12121 | Wu         | Finance    |  90000.00
 15151 | Mozart     | Music      |  40000.00
 1     | Tesla      | Elec. Eng. |   NULL       
(3 rows)
```

Then using the previous query will not give 0 as shown below:- 

```
university=# SELECT AVG(salary) - (SUM(salary)/COUNT(*))
university-# FROM instructor
university-# ;
      ?column?      
--------------------
 21666.666666666667
(1 row)

university=# 
```

This is because of the NULL salary of the instructor 'Tesla'.

All aggregate functions except **count(*)** ignore null values in their input collection. 

Thus _AVG(salary)_ computes: 

$$
    \frac {90000 + 40000} {2} = \frac {130000} {2} = 65000.0
$$

While _SUM(salary)/COUNT(*)_ computes: 

$$
    \frac {SUM(salary)}{COUNT(*)} = \frac {90000 + 40000} {3} = \frac {130000} {3} = 43333.333333333336
$$

Which are not equal. Which explains the non-zero answer of the query in question.
