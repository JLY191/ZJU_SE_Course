* Earlier-generation database applications used a **two-tier architecture**, where as
a **three-tier architecture** is used by a modern database application. 

* In a **two-tier architecture** the application resides at the client machine, and invokes
database system functionality at the server machine through query language statements. 
In a **three-tier architecture** the client machine acts as merely a front end and 
_does not contain any direct database calls_ ; the front end communicates with an 
**application server**. The application server, in turn, communicates with a database
system to access data. 

* Three-tier applications provide better security as well as better performance
than two-tier applications. 

Note: Even though the book classifies database applications in to two, the reality is 
that most famous applications use **four-tier architecture**. If we take most chatting
mobile applications they are a **three-tier architecture** with a local database
such as sqlite for caching the data and accessing it when the mobile is not connected
to the internet.
