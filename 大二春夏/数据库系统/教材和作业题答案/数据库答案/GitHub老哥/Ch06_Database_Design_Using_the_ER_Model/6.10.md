--------------------------------

The foreign-key attribute in $R$ corresponding to the primary key of $B$ should be 
made **NOT NULL**. This ensures that no tuple of $A$ which is not related to any entry
in $B$ under $R$ can come in $R$. For example, say **a** is a tuple in $A$ which has no 
corresponding entry in $R$. This means when $R$ is combined with $A$, it would have 
a foreign-key attribute corresponding to $B$ as **NULL**, which is not allowed.
