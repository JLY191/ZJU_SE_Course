> Explain the distinctions among the terms _primary key_, _candidate key_, and _superkey_. 

--------------------------------

A **superkey** is a set of one or more attributes that, taken collectively, allow us to 
identify uniquely a tuple in the relation. 

A **candidate key** is a superkey for which no proper subset is a superkey. 

A **primary key** is a candidate key that is chosen by the database designer as the principal
means of identifying tuples within a relation.
