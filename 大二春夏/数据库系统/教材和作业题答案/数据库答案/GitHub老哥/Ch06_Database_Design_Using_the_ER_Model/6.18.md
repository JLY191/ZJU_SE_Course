--------------------------------

a. Rename the attribute $X$ to something that describes more info in both entity sets, so that 
it can have a different name in both the entity sets. 

b. 

### Case 1: $X$ is the primary key for $A$ but not $B$
In this case we would create a foreign-key constraint on the attribute $X$ of the entity 
set $B$ referencing the entity set $A$.

### Case 2: $X$ is the primary key for both $A$ and $B$
In this case we merge the two entity sets $A$ and $B$ into one entity set $C$. 
The new entity set $C$ will have the attribute $X$ as a primary key and moreover it will
have all the other attributes of $A$ and $B$ (making proper attribute name modifications, if needed).

### Case 3: $X$ is not the primary key for $A$ nor for $B$
In this case we can create a new entity set called $C$ having a single attribute $X$. 
And the attribute $X$ in $A$ and $B$ will be a foreign-key referencing the attribute $X$ in the 
entity set $C$. This also gives room for storing more information about the attribute $X$ in side of
the entity set $C$.
