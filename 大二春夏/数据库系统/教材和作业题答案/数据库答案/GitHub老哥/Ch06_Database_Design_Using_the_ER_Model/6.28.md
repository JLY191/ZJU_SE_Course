> Explain the distinction between total and partial constraints. 

--------------------------------

* **Total specialization constraint** - Each higher-level entity must belong to a 
lower-level entity set. 
* **Partial specialization constraint** - Some higher-level entities may not belong 
to any lower-level entity set.
