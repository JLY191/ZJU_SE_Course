> a. What is an XSS attack? 

**Cross-site scripting (XSS)** is a type of security vulnerability, seen on some websites that
allows users to enter text, such as comment or name, and then stores it and later 
displays it to other users. In such an attack, a malicious user enters code written in 
a client-side scripting language such as JavaScript or Flash instead of entering a valid
name or comment. When a different user views the entered text, the browser executes the script, 
which can carry out actions as sending private cookie information back to the malicious 
user or even executing an action on a different web server that the user may be logged into. 

> b. How can the referer field be used to detect some XSS attacks? 

The **referer** of a page access, is the URL of the page that had the link 
that user clicked on to initiate the page access. By checking that the referer is valid, 
for example, that the referer URL is a page on the same website, XSS attacks that originated 
on a different web page accessed by the user can be prevented.
