> What are two advantages of encrypting data stored in the database? 

--------------------------------

* Encrypting data stored in databases, protects against attackers who
can access the disk contents but do not have access to the encryption key. 

* Encryption at the database level has the advantage of requiring relatively
low time and space overhead and does not require modification of applications.
