--------------------------------

```cpp
// represents a single connection to the database. 
class Connection { 

} 

// represents a connection pool 
class ConnectionPool { 
    // a list of connections that are in the pool. 
    List<Connection> listOfConnections;
}

// a function to create a pool
ConnectionPool createConnectionPool(string db_conn, string db_username, string db_password) { 

}

// a function to request a connection 
// from the pool
Connection getConnectionFromPool(ConnectionPool pool) { 

}

// a function to release a connection to the pool
void releaseConnectionToThePool(ConnectionPool pool, Connection conn) { 

}

// a function to close the connection pool
void closeConnection(ConnectionPool pool) { 
    
}

```
