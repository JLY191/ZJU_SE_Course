The following uses Postgresql server 13.8.

The following paragraph is taken from Postgresql documentation Chapter 39 Triggers. 

The trigger function must be defined before the trigger itself can be 
created. The trigger function must be declared as a function taking no arguments and 
returning type `trigger`. (The trigger function receives its input through a 
specially-passed `TriggerData` structure, not in the form of ordinary function arguments.)

```sql 
CREATE TYPE OPERATION_TYPE AS ENUM ('insert', 'update', 'delete');

CREATE TABLE takes_trail ( 
    id                   BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY, 
    userid               VARCHAR(5),  -- the user id that performed the change. 
    change_occured_at    TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE, -- timestamp when the change occured. 
    old_value            JSONB DEFAULT NULL, -- the old tuple of takes encoded as json
    new_value            JSONB DEFAULT NULL, -- the new tuple of takes encoded as json
    change_type          OPERATION_TYPE NOT NULL -- type of change that occured on the takes relation
);

CREATE FUNCTION audit_trail_takes() RETURNS trigger AS $audit_trail_takes$
    BEGIN 
    --
    -- Create a row in takes_trail to reflect the operation performed 
    -- on takes, making use of the special variable TG_OP to work out 
    -- the operation. 
    -- 
    IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN 
        INSERT INTO takes_trail (userid, change_occured_at, old_value, change_type)
        VALUES (user_id(), now(), to_json(OLD), 'delete');
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN 
        INSERT INTO takes_trail (userid, change_occured_at, old_value, new_value, change_type)
        VALUES (user_id(), now(), to_json(OLD), to_json(NEW), 'update');
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN 
        INSERT INTO takes_trail (userid, change_occured_at, new_value, change_type)
        VALUES (user_id(), now(), to_json(NEW), 'insert');
    END IF;
    RETURN NEW;

    END;
$audit_trail_takes$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER audit_trail_takes
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON takes
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_trail_takes();
```

After an update, delete and insert operations on the _takes_ relation the query 

```sql 
SELECT * FROM takes_trail
```

results:-

```
 id | userid |       change_occured_at       |                                               old_value                                               |                                               new_value                                               | change_type

(3 rows)
```

Note that I have replaced the non-existent function _user_id()_ in the definition of the plpgsql function by the string **'NSR56'**.

I used json data types for the attributes _old_value_ and _new_value_ because the schema of the 
_takes_ relation can change over time. The trigger code given above would still work 
in such a scenario.

It **cannot** guarantee that updates made by a malicious database administrator, will be in 
the audit trail. This is because the database admin will have the privilege to delete rows from 
the _takes_trail_ relation.
