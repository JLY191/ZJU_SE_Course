The following predicate would be associated with the _takes_ relation. 

```sql
(course_id, sec_id, semester, year) IN (
    SELECT course_id, sec_id, semester, year
    FROM teaches
    WHERE id = syscontext.user_id()
) 
```

> b. Give an SQL query such that the query with the predicate added gives a result
> that is a subset of the original query result without the added predicate. 

```sql 
SELECT * FROM takes
```

> c. Give an SQL query such that the query with the predicate added gives a result

> predicate. 

No such query exists.
