--------------------------------

The key problem with digital certificates (when used offline, without 
contacting the certificate issuer) is that there is no way to withdraw
them. 

For instance (this actually happened, but names of the parties have been changed)
person $C$ claims to be an employee of company $X$ and gets a new public key 
certified by the certifying authority $A$. Suppose the authority $A$ 
incorrectly believed that $C$ was acting on behalf of company $X$, and 
it gave $C$ a certificate _cert_. Now $C$ can communicate with person $Y$, who 
checks the certificate _cert_ presented by $C$ and believes the public key
contained in _cert_ really belongs to $X$. $C$ can communicate with $Y$ using 
the public key, and $Y$ trusts the communication is from company $X$. 

Person $Y$ may now reveal confidential information to $C$ or accept a purchase 
order from $C$ or execute programs certified by $C$, based on the public key, 
thinking he is actually communicating with company $X$. In each case there is 
potential for harm to $Y$. 

Even if $A$ detects the impersonation, as long as $Y$ does not check with $A$
(the protocol does not require this check), there is no way for $Y$ to find 
out that the certificate is forged. 

If $X$ was a certification authority itself, further levels of fake certificates
could be created. But certificates that are not part of this chain would not be
affected.
