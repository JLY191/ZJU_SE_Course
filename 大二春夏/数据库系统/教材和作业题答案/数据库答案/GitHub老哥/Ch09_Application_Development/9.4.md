--------------------------------

Although the link to the page is shown only to authorized users, an 
unauthorized user may somehow come to know of the existence of the 
link (for example, from an unauthorized user, or via web proxy logs). 
The user may then log in to the system and access the unauthorized 
page by entering its URL in the browser. If the check for user 
authorization was inadvertently left out from the page, the user 
will be able to see the result of the page. 

The HTTP referer attribute can be used to block a naive attempt to 
exploit such loopholes by ensuring the referer value is from a valid 
page of the web site. However, the referer attribute is set by the 
browser and can be spoofed, so a malicious user can easily work around 
the referer check.
