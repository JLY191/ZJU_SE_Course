The following is taken from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication). 

**Challenge-response authentication** is a family of protocols in which one party presents
a question ("challenge") and another party must provide a valid answer ("response") to be 
authenticated. 

The simplest example of a challenge-response protocol is password authentication, where the 
challenge is asking for the password and the valid response is the correct password.
