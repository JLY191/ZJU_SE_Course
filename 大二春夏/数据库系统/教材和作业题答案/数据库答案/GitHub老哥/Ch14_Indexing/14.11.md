--------------------------------

If there have been no updates in a while, but there are a lot of index look ups on an 
index, then entries at one level, say $i$, can be merged into the next level, even if the 
level is not full. The benefit is that reads would then not have to look up indices at level 
$i$, reducing the cost of reads.
