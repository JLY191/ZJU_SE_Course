> When is it preferable to use a dense index rather than a sparse index? Explain your answer. 

--------------------------------

1. If the relation is **NOT** stored in a sorted order of the search key, then we cannot 
use sparse index. We have to use a dense index. 

2. If our use case doesn't involve too many updates (insertions, deletions) and we have enough 
storage space then dense index is preferable.
