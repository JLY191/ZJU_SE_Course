> What trade-offs do write-optimized indices pose as compared to B+-tree indices? 

--------------------------------

**Write-optimized indices** (such as **LSM trees**, **buffer trees**, ...) have very efficient
write methods that are much faster than B+-tree's writes. But they offer this write efficiency
at the cost of lookup efficiency. Lookup on LSM trees for example costs more than lookup on 
B+-trees, since a single lookup on LSM trees would require looking up multiple B+-trees.
