> What is the difference between a clustering index and a secondary index? 

--------------------------------

A **clustering index** is an index whose search key also defines the sequential 
order of the file. A **clustering index** is also called a **primary index**. 

A **secondary index** also known as **nonclustering index** is an index whose 
search key specifies an order different from the sequential order of the file.
