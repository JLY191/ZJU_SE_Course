We reproduce the instructor relation below:

Bitmaps for _salary_, with $S_1$, $S_2$, $S_3$ and $S_4$ representing the given intervals 
in the same order.

The question is a bit trivial if there is no bitmap on the _dept_name_ attribute. The bitmap for 
the _dept_name_ attribute is:

To find all instructors in the Finance department with salary of $80,000$ or more, we first 
find the intersection of the Finance department bitmap and $S_4$ bitmap of _salary_ and then scan 
on these records for salary of $80,000$ or more. 

Intersection of Finance department bitmap and $S_4$ bitmap of _salary_:

Scan on these records with salary $80,000$ or more gives Wu and Singh as the instructors who 
satisfy the given query.
