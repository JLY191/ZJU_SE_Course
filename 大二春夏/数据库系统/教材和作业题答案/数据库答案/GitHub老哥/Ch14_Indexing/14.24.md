--------------------------------

Let $r(A, B, C)$ be a relation. Suppose there is a bitmap index on the attribute $A$. 
Suppose the attribute $A$ can have 2 distinct values and can also be _null_. Thus the bitmap 
index on the attribute $A$ is going to have 3 bitmaps, namely: $S_1, S_2, S_{null}$. 

Thus, the _existence bitmap_ can be computed as follows:-

$$
S_1 \vee S_2 \vee S_{null}
$$

where $\vee$ denotes the bitwise or operator.
