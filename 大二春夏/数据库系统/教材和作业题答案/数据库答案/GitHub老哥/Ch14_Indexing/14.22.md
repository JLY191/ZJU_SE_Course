If a node split happens on the file organization, there needs to be a corresponding 
change on the secondary index. The pointers to the records, where the records are 
the ones that are stored inside of the nodes that splitted, need to be updated.

It depends on the type of secondary index that we are using. Suppose our secondary index 
is a B+-tree, let $h$ be height of our tree and $n$ be the number of affected records. 
Then the cost of updating all affected records in this secondary index would be $O(hn)$.

If we use the search key of the file organization as a logical record identifier, then we don't 
have make changes to the secondary-index when a node splits inside of the file organization. 

There is a famous quote:- 

"Every problem in Computer Science can be solved by another level of indirection. ðŸ˜œ"

> d. What is the extra cost due to the use of such logical record identifiers?

Let $h_1$ be height of the secondary index (assuming our secondary index is a B+-tree). 

Let $h_2$ be height of the file organization. 

When we perform a lookup using the secondary index:
1. If the secondary index uses record identifiers that are pointers to records on disk: $O(h_1)$.
2. If the secondary index uses logical record indentifiers (search keys of the file organization): $O(h_1 + h_2)$.
