> a. Explain why sequentiality may be lost. 

In a B+-tree index or file organization, leaf nodes that are adjacent to each other in the 
tree may be located at different places on disk. When a file organization is newly created 
on a set of records, it is possible to allocate blocks that are mostly contiguous on disk to 
leaf nodes that are contiguous in the tree. As insertions and deletions occur on the tree, 
sequentiality is increasingly lost, and sequential access has to wait for disk seeks increasingly
often.

In the worst case, each $n$-block unit and each node of the B+-tree is half filled. This 
gives the worst-case occupancy as 25 percent.

No. While splitting the $n$-block unit, the first $n/2$ leaf pages are placed in one $n$-block 
unit and the remaining pages in the second $n$-block unit. That is, every $n$-block split 
maintains the order. Hence, the nodes in the $n$-block unit are consecutive.

In the regular B+-tree construction, the leaf pages might not be sequential and hence in the 
worst-case, it takes one seek per leaf page. Using the block at a time method, for each 
$n$-node block, we will have at least $n/2$ leaf nodes in it. Each $n$-node block can be read
using one seek. Hence the worst-case seeks come down by a factor of $n/2$.

Allowing redistribution among the nodes of the same $n$-block unit does not require 
additional seeks, whereas in regular B+-trees we require as many seeks as the number of 
leaf pages involved in the redistribution. This makes redistribution for leaf blocks 
efficient with this scheme. Also, the worst-case occupancy comes back to nearly 50 percent. 
(Splitting of leaf nodes is preferred when the participating leaf nodes are nearly full. 
Hence nearly 50 percent instead of exact 50 percent.)
