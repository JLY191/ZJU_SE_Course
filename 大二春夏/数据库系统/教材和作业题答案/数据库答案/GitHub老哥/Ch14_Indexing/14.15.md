--------------------------------

Start with regions with very small radius, and retry with a larger radius if a particular 
region does not contain any result. For example, each time the radius could be increased by 
a factor of (say) 1.5. The benefit is that since we do not use a very large radius 
compared to the minimum radius required, there will (hopefully!) not be too many points
in the circular range query result.
