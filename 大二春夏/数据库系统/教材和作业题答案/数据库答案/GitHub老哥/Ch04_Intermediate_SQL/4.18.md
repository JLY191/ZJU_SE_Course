--------------------------------

Note that, the primary key of the _manages_ relation is _id_. Thus each employee can
have at most one manager. 

Using an outer join we can write the query as:- 

```sql
SELECT e.id
FROM employee e LEFT OUTER JOIN manages m 
    ON e.id = m.id
WHERE m.id IS NULL 
    OR m.manager_id IS NULL;
```

Using no outer join we can write the query as:- 

```sql
SELECT id
FROM employee
WHERE id NOT IN (
    -- this gives us all of the employee ids that have a manager
    SELECT id
    FROM manages
    WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
);
```
