--------------------------------

Appending **NATURAL JOIN** _section_ in the **FROM** clause would not change the 
result because there is no logic in the query that uses attributes in _section_ that 
are not found in _takes_ relation. Also since every tuple in _takes_ relation has a corresponding
tuple in the _section_ relation (due to foreign key constraint), there will be no change if we append
the **NATURAL JOIN** _section_ in the **FROM** clause.
