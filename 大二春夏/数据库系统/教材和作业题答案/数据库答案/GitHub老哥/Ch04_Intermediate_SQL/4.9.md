--------------------------------

The tuples of all employees of the manager, at all levels, get deleted as well!
This happens in a series of steps. The inital deletion will 
trigger deletion of all the tuples corresponding to direct
employees of the manager. These deletions will in turn cause
deletions of second-level employee tuples, and so on, till all 
direct and indirect employee tuples are deleted.
