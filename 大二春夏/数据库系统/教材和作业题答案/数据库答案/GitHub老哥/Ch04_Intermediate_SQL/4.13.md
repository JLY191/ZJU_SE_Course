--------------------------------

* No. This allows a user to be granted access to only part of relation _r_. 

* Yes. A valid update issued using view _v_ must update _r_ for the update to be
stoared in the database. 

* Any tuple _t_ compatible with the schema for _v_ but not satisfying the **where**
clause in the definiton of view _v_ is a valid example. ONe such example appears in 
Section 4.2.4.
