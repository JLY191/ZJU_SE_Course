--------------------------------

Assume the grant is done by the user Satoshi instead of the manager role. Then if Satoshi
leaves the company one day, and the DBA revokes Satoshi's authorization, all of the employees
granted by Satoshi will have their authorization revoked. 

If the DBA doesn't want that, he should have the manager role grant an authorization instead of
the user Satoshi.
